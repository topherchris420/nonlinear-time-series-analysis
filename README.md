# Nonlinear Time Series Analysis

Dynamic Resonance Rooting (DRR) framework for phase transition detection and generative structure analysis in complex adaptive systems.

## Features

- Time-delay embedding of time series data  
- Wavelet-spectral analysis for resonance detection  
- Transfer entropy calculation for causal influence mapping  
- Attractor geometry and stability metrics computation

## Installation

Requires Python 3.8+ and dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
